DinoBot â€“ Google Dinosaur Game Automation Bot
Welcome to DinoBot, a Python-based automation project that plays the Google Dinosaur game autonomously. Using Selenium WebDriver and PyAutoGUI, this bot detects obstacles in real-time with pixel-based recognition and simulates key presses to help the dinosaur jump over obstacles.
